Girlfriend (100 Marks)
There are N number of houses in the La La Land and R number of roads connecting the houses. Each house is marked from 1 to N. B lives in house number 1 and his girlfriend Anjali lives in the Nth house. Anjali is home alone today and has hurt herself while she was trying to make a present for B. B gets to know about it and wants to go to meet Anjali in the most cost efficient way as it is the month end and he does not have a lot of money with him. Since Anjali lives far away, B will use the taxi to reach her house.


The La La Land has a unique system of fare collection by taxis.

Each road has a cost associated with it to travel on it.


There might or might not be a direct road between any two houses.


To travel on a road connecting Ni and Nj, the person has to pay the difference in cost price connecting (Ni, Nj) and the total cost to reach Ni.

Example:
Consider three houses H1, H2 and H3





The cost to travel from H2 to H3 is 15.

Cost = Cost of travel between (H2, H3) - Total cost to reach H2 = 25 - 10 = 15


Note: If the difference comes out to be negative, it is free of cost for a person to travel on the road between Hi and Hj.


The roads are bidirectional (directionless).


B is good in the subject of love but is very poor in the subject of mathematics. Can you help B determine the cost he would have to pay to reach Anjali if it is possible otherwise just tell him NOT POSSIBLE.


Example:

Number of houses, N = 5
Number of roads, R = 5


Consider the connection graph given below.






There are two ways in which B (1) can reach Anjali’s house (5).


Route 1: 1 - 2 - 5


Cost of travel from 1 to 2 = 30

Cost of travel from 2 to 5 = 40 - 30 = 10


Total cost of travel = 30 + 10 = 40


Route 2: 1 - 3 - 4 - 5


Cost of travel from 1 to 3 = 10

Cost of travel from 3 to 4 = 20 - 10 = 10
Cost of travel from 4 to 5 = 30 - 20 (Total cost of travel to reach 4, 10 + 10) = 10


Total cost of travel = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30


Route 2 is better suited for B as it is cost efficient and he would have to 30.

Input Format
The first line of input consists of two space-separated integers: number of houses, N and number of roads, R.

Next R lines each consists of three space-separated integers: starting node (house), Ni; ending node (house), Nj and Cost of travel on Road Ri connecting Ni and Nj, C.

Constraints
1<= N <=50000

1<= R < 500000

1<= C (Cost of travel on road connection two houses) <= 10^7 (1e7)




Output Format
If it is possible for B to reach Anjali’s house, print the minimum amount of fare he has to pay to taxi otherwise print NOT POSSIBLE.
